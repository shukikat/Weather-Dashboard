# Weather-Dashboard
This is an app to check the weather in multiple cities to plan a trip accordingly.

## Description

This project is an application to get the 5-day forecast of a particular city so a user can plan for their trips accordingly. In addition, the cities input for the search are saved. The user can click on that city again to get up-to-date forecasts.

## Installation

This project is coded in Typescript. To run and initiate the app the user must install Express using the command `npm install express`. In addition, the live url can be deployed using the Render app. 

## Usage 

Prerequisites: As noted above the user must have Node.js Express package installed.

To run this project:

- Open the command line on your device.
- Navigate to the directory of your project that contains the `package.json`      file. 
- Run the command `npm start` (this may vary based on scripts' specifics in your `package.json` file). 
- Upon running `npm start` the Node application is initiated.

## Contributions

I received assistance on the project by using the tool, Xpert Learning Assistant, available through my Columbia Engineering Bootcamp account. This tool helped guide me through some difficulties I had in executing my api calls, adding applicable parameters to various methods in the weatherService class, and providing explanations on functionalities of preexisting code.
